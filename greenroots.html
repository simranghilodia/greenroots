  <h1>Project Proposal: GreenRoots – Empowering Organic Farming</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In recent years, consumers have become increasingly aware of the health and environmental benefits of organic produce.
      However, despite rising demand, India's organic farming ecosystem faces significant hurdles, including limited farmer adoption,
      lack of guidance, and unfair pricing due to middlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>GreenRoots</strong> proposes to create a digital platform that not only <strong>educates and empowers farmers</strong> to transition to organic practices,
      but also <strong>connects them directly to end consumers</strong> through a transparent, fair-priced marketplace.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Limited adoption of organic farming:</strong> Many farmers lack access to proper training, resources, or incentives to switch to organic methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Middlemen exploitation:</strong> Farmers who do grow organic produce often have to sell through intermediaries, earning very little despite charging a premium to consumers.</li>
      <li><strong>Consumer distrust:</strong> Buyers are often unsure if produce labeled “organic” is genuinely certified or worth the premium price.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of direct farmer-to-consumer platforms:</strong> Few reliable systems connect organic farmers directly with consumers, limiting income and trust on both ends.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This system discourages sustainable farming and deprives both farmers and consumers of the full benefits of organic produce.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>GreenRoots</strong> will be a <strong>digital platform</strong> designed to solve this dual challenge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helping farmers <strong>transition to organic farming</strong> through step-by-step guidance and certification support.</li>
      <li>Providing a <strong>direct-to-consumer marketplace</strong> where verified organic farmers can sell their products at transparent, fair prices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal is to build a <strong>trust-based ecosystem</strong> that promotes health, sustainability, and farmer prosperity.
